CONTROLLER TRANSFORMER

The Controller Transformer can transform incoming midi controller events into another controller event type. For instance, you could control volume with the external keyboard modulation wheel, for example.

Each line in the list corresponds to an original controller which is transformed to a new controller. For each transformation,  create a new list entry and give it a suitable name in the field at the bottom of the window (e.g. "Mod->Vol"), Select the original controller (e.g. 1 = modulation) with the Set Original gadget and select a destination controller (e.g. 7 = volume) with the Set Destination gadget.

Controller select requesters depends on the instrument of the selected track.

Only the transformations with a tick in the check box will be active.
